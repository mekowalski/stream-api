# JSON Server Docs
- `npmjs.com/package/json-server`
- Can create a `db.json` file
- Any records that are trying to be saved to API Server will automatically be stored in `db.json`

1. [] Create `db.json` with resource type: streams
      - As streams are created, they will be stored into the array of streams (within `db.json`)
